[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/Raul6469/wip-pr.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Derived version of the original [wip-bot](https://github.com/gr2m/wip-bot).

:sparkles: **Only sets the commit status to `failure` on the PR's head. When new commits are pushed, the `failure` status is removed from previous commits!**

Also supports WIP labels that contains `wip` or `do not merge`.
